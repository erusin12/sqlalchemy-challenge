# sqlalchemy-challenge
 Challenge 10

This assignment used SQL Alchemy and Flask to analyze the weather in Hawaii.  Starter data and code was provided.  

For the first half of the homework, it was created in Jupyter Notebook to connect to the SQLite database provided.  A precipitation analysis and then station analysis were created and charts for each were done with matplotlib.    

The second part involved us creating a Flask API, listing the routes and having all pages route.  The ‘start’ and ‘start/end’ routes were gone over in office hours as many of us were unsure how to get the dynamic APIs to work.  I was able to get these to work when using date in the format of ‘YYYY-MM-DD’.  

This homework was created with the assistance of time with the instructor/office hours, a study group, and internet resources.
